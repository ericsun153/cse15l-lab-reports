# How to find a *failure-inducing input*, and use it to test and debug our code efficiently?
## Setups
> In this lab report, we will mainly focus on incremental and test-driven development that can let us test and debug our program more easily, logically and effieciently.


* The first step is to use the **Fork** function of Github, it can makes a copy of the repository on your own Github page.


![Image1](Week4/Fork.jpg)

* Then we **Fetch** this repository to our Github desktop in order to implement the debug process on our own Visual Studio Code:

![Image2](Week4/Fetch.jpg)
```
javac MarkdownParse.java
java MarkdownParse test-file.md
```

## Breaking Tests
> The following are different **breaking tests** under different situations that I found during the testing and debugging process of `MarkdownParse.java`.

### Test 1ï¼šInfinite loop
> The first breaking test case is happening when I add one extra blank line at the end of the test-file markdown.

* Code changes:

![image3](Week4/Test1code.png)

* [Here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-file.md) is the link to my breaking test case 1 of **Infinite Loop**.

* Symptom:

![image4](Week4/Test1symptom.png)

* **Relationship between the bugs:**
* After the specified improvement to this test case, we are able to successfully find and get the correct output of `[https://something.html, some-thing.html]` as the following picture:

### Test 2: Image contained test
> This breaking test is appearing when we insert the images among the syntax of links.

* Code changes:

![test2code](Week4/test2code.png)

* [Here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test3.md) is the link to my breaking test case 2 of **Containing Image**.

* Symptom:

![image4](Week4/test2symp.png)

* **Relationship between the bugs:**
* After the specified improvement to this test case, we are able to successfully find and get the correct output of `[some-thing.html]` as the following picture:

### Test 3: More complicated and general cases
> In this topic, we will explore on more complicated and edge cases to make our `MarkdownParse.java` to break down.

* Code changes:

![code1](Week4/3code1.png)
![code2](Week4/3code2.png)
![code3](Week4/3code3.png)

#### 3.1 File with a link in the middle
> Test case:
![case3.1](Week4/3.1case.png)

* Test 3.1 Link [here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test8.md).

* Symptom:

![sym3.1](Week4/3.1sympt.png)

* **Relationship between the bugs:**

* After improving, the output should be `[link.html]`:
![success3.1](Week4/3.1success.png)

#### 3.2 File that uses `[]` but not `()`
> Test case:
![case3.2](Week4/3.2case.png)

* Test 3.2 Link [here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test5.md).

* Symptom:

![sym3.2](Week4/3.2sympt.png)

* **Relationship between the bugs:**

* After improving, the output should be `[]`:
![success3.2](Week4/3.2success.png)

#### 3.3 File with no links
> Test case:
![case3.3](Week4/3.3case.png)

* Test 3.3 Link [here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test4.md).

* Symptom:

![sym3.3](Week4/3.3sympt.png)

* **Relationship between the bugs:**

* After improving, the output should be `[]`:
![success3.3](Week4/3.3success.png)
