# How to find a *failure-inducing input*, and use it to test and debug our code efficiently?
## Setups
> In this lab report, we will mainly focus on incremental and test-driven development that can let us test and debug our program more easily, logically and effieciently.
1. The first step is to use the **Fork** function of Github, it can makes a copy of the repository on your own Github page.

2. Then we **Fetch** this repository to our Github desktop in order to implement the debug process on our own Visual Studio Code:

```
javac MarkdownParse.java
java MarkdownParse test-file.md
```

> The following are different **breaking tests** under different situations that I found during the testing and debugging process of `MarkdownParse.java`.

## Test 1ï¼šInfinite loop
