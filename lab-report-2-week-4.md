# How to find a *failure-inducing input*, and use it to test and debug our code efficiently?
## Setups
> In this lab report, we will mainly focus on incremental and test-driven development that can let us test and debug our program more easily, logically and effieciently.


* The first step is to use the **Fork** function of Github, it can makes a copy of the repository on your own Github page.

* Then we **Fetch** this repository to our Github desktop in order to implement the debug process on our own Visual Studio Code:

```
javac MarkdownParse.java
java MarkdownParse test-file.md
```

## Breaking Tests
> The following are different **breaking tests** under different situations that I found during the testing and debugging process of `MarkdownParse.java`.

### Test 1ï¼šInfinite loop
> The first breaking test case is happening when I add one extra blank line at the end of the test-file markdown.

* Code changes:

* [Here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-file.md) is the link to my breaking test case 1 of **Infinite Loop**.

* Symptom:

* **Relationship between the bugs:**
* After the specified improvement to this test case, we are able to successfully find and get the correct output of `[https://something.html, some-thing.html]` as the following picture:

### Test 2: Image contained test
> This breaking test is appearing when we insert the images among the syntax of links.

* [Here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser/blob/main/test3.md) is the link to my breaking test case 2 of **Containing Image**.

* Symptom:
