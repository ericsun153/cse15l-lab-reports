# How to use *JUnit* to run the given test and *Clean* our code to an optimal effiency?

* [Here](https://github.com/ericsun153/markdown-parser) is the link to **my** implementation of MarkdownParse repository.

## Snippet 1
* After using the preview function VSCode, the expected result for Snippet 1 should be:

* As a result, its expected value should be `[url.com, `\``google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]`. Moreover, here is the code used for testing Snippet 1 using *JUnit*:

## Snippet 2

* After using the preview function VSCode, the result for Snippet 2 should be:

* As a result, its expected value should be `[b.com, a.com(()), example.com]`. Moreover, here is the code used for testing Snippet 2 using *JUnit*:

## Snippet 3

* After using the preview function VSCode, the result for Snippet 3 should be:

## More on Snippets
* For Snippet 1, it seems my program work has already passed the test, so there is unnecessary to have a code change. As a result, I think the my codes can be cleaned and make it into a more efficient program.

* For Snippet 2, my program work didn't pass the test.

* For Snippet 3, my program work didn't pass the test.
